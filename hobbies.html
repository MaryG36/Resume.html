    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Playing video games. I can play Zelda games for hours, the dungeons require logic skills and how to maneuver around and manipulate objects. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Hiking. I enjoy being outdoors and surrounded by nature and water.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Travelling. Visiting new places and going to the beach is something I could do everyday and never get bored of.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Food. I am a foodie and I like to make all kinds of different foods and desserts. The best part is getting to eat it at the end.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Language Learning. I have been learning language since I was a child. It has always  been a big hobby of mine and currently I know 3 languages.
        <ul>
            <br>
            <li>English - Native</li>
            <li>Chinese - Intermediate</li>
            <li>Russian - Working proficiency</li>
           
        </ul>
        <br>
        Although I plan on learning more in the future!
